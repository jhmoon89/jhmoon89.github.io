## Jihoon Moon

I am a PhD student at Purdue University, Assitive Robotics Technology Laboratory, advised by [C. S. George Lee] (https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/Administration/AcademicAffairs/Events/Colloquia/lee). 
My research interests are in the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics.
