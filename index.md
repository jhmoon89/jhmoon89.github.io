## About Me

<!-- Hi! I am a Post-Doc Researcher in Lab of AI and Robotics ([Lair](https://lair.unist.ac.kr/)) at SKKU advised by Prof. [Hyeonwoo yu](https://bogus2000.github.io/). My current research area is Reinforcement Learning for Robotics. During my Ph.D., I focused on developing machine learning systems for visual understanding. My industry experience spans deploying real-time face and pupil tracking models, optimizing deep networks with TensorRT, and building scalable, efficient AI pipelines. I thrive at the intersection of research and engineering, with a passion for turning cutting-edge ideas into practical, high-impact solutions. -->
